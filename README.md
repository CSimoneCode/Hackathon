2020 has certainly been a doozy of a year. Looking back, we thought about the things we wish we had been able to do and the tools we wish we had had at our disposal, to weather this stormy year. 
With all the Netflix parties, evenings of online game nights, and Zoom happy hours and book clubs this year, we realized that we really would have loved the idea to share drinks with our friends. It would have been amazing to have a signature cocktail to go with the theme of that Netflix movie EVERYONE was talking about! It could have been a lot of fun to have a themed drink to go along with the book of the month in our virtual book club. 
That's a service we could really get in to!
Currently only available in the Bay Area, with investor funding we plan to scale to include all urban areas (within legal limitations) across the US!
